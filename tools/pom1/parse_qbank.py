"""Turn the four PoM 1 Question Bank PDFs into pom1/data/questions/<slug>.json.

Purpose: parse the student-written PoM 1 block banks into the portal's question
         schema, answer keys, rationales and figures included.
Author:  Noor Sims
Date:    2026-09-25
Input:   the four "<system> - P1 QBank" PDFs (dir via $POM1_QBANK_DIR)
Output:  pom1/data/questions/cardio|resp|ent|gi|gu.json, and a report on stdout

The same volunteers laid these out the same way as the FoM banks a year earlier,
down to the indents: a question number at the left margin (x ~ 72), its stem one
indent in (x ~ 93), an option letter at a second (x ~ 115) and an option wrap at
a third (x ~ 136), with a 28pt week heading and 14-16pt section headings. So the
walker is FoM's, imported rather than copied, and what is written out here is
what actually differs - the files, the weeks, and the sections.

Two things differ from FoM and both are structural:

* **Sections.** FoM ran module / RA / SA / Meds2024 / new. PoM 1 runs module /
  weekly quiz / Meds2024 / new, with "Questions from the Week" as a *parent*
  heading over the first two. That parent is not a section and is ignored;
  because a week heading resets the section anyway, ignoring it cannot leave a
  question filed under the previous week's set.

* **An option letter alone on its line.** Most of these banks set an option as
  "A. Aortic" on one line, but a tab-stopped stretch of them sets the letter at
  x ~ 115 and its text at x ~ 143, in two line boxes. Reading only the first
  shape left 1,100 questions with their options buried in the stem and no
  letters to score against, which is what OPT_ONLY_RE is for: a bare letter
  opens an option whose body is whatever follows at the deeper indent.

* **A different option indent per PDF.** Cardiology and Respirology set their
  option letters at x ~ 115, Gastroenterology and Genitourinary at x ~ 100 -
  inside the band FoM's walker reads as the stem's own wrap. Rather than tune a
  number per file, an indented line opens an option when it is lettered *and*
  that letter is the one due next (A, then B, ...), which a wrapped stem line
  never is.

* **Five blocks out of four PDFs.** The Respirology bank covers weeks 6 to 9,
  and week 9 is ENT - a block of its own in the course's timetable and in the
  vault. So the Resp PDF is read once and split on the week number, which is
  the same rule the rest of the file already files by.

The "P1 Practice Questions, Class of 2024" PDF is deliberately **not** a fifth
set: the block banks' Meds2024 sections already re-file it week by week. See
check_practice.py, which is the test of that claim rather than an assertion of
it.
