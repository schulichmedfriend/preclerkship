"""Regenerate every course's block pages from one template.

Purpose: build one page per block, for every course in the portal, so the four
         courses cannot drift into four layouts.
Author:  Noor Sims
Date:    2026-09-21
Input:   tools/portal.py (the course roster), each course's data/, and the page
         being replaced (for its blurb and accent, so hand edits survive)
Output:  <course>/<block>.html

Run from the repo root. A course with no blocks yet is skipped; its landing page
still renders from build_index.py, saying it is empty.
